- What times does someone get paired w/another player? Maybe we should have users input frees & then include lunches n stuff so the notif for a game only gets sent out there? or like when does it "decide" that someone is playing at a given time? does everyone get to play everyday?

- A player should be able to indicate when they don't want to play-- like if they're doing a test retake during a block or meeting with a teacher, it would be unfair to put them in a match they can't participate in

-there should be a passive point system that triggers if someone has their phone on campus but doesn't look at it the entire day, thus encouraging points by either playing it risky or playing it safe & encourage more offline-stuff. maybe if you scroll on computer aswell it deducts points

-Along with the users oponent, Teachers should be able to see a player's location if they look at a hint. this should only be for teachers interested in the app.

-if your start screen is joining a lobby, wouldn't you have to take your phone out in the first place? I feel like it needs to be something that starts without u needing to even look at your phone, so it's like a challenge (which would also make more sense for passive points that encourage users off their phone)

-multiplayer mode would be awesome aswell, so u can have multiple people at once

- you should also be able to control whos playing with you-- lobby code among-us style & then everyone would have fun reporting their friends

- although i get the high-risk high-reward part of the game, I do feel like there's not enough incentive to start playing the game in the first place. like these points feel like they're just for bragging rights and the risk of losing ur phone for a literal month or even the whole year if caught <10 times just seems like no one would even want to give it a go. I think if there was some point exchange that the player can "spend" points on IRL stuff, like things in the HW student store or customizations in game (though still dont think that would be enough incentive)
